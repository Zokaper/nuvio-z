# Nuvio Z Status

Last updated: 2026-08-02

## Current Snapshot

- Base: NuvioMobile commit `979d5680`.
- Working branch: `main`.
- Official repository is configured as `upstream`.
- Private `origin` repository: `https://github.com/Zokaper/nuvio-z`.
- Android identity: Nuvio Z, `com.nuvio.app.z`
  (`com.nuvio.app.z.debug` for debug).
- Signed personal release builds use an ignored local keystore.
- Latest signed arm64 APK was installed successfully on a Samsung Android
  device and launches alongside official Nuvio.

## Completed

- Added Saver, Balanced, and Quality download presets with editable resolution,
  GB/hour cap, codec, HDR/Dolby Vision, and audio-language preferences.
- Added movie, episode, season, and selected-season batch planning.
- Added generic Stremio source normalization and bounded AIOStreams structured
  metadata support.
- Added global addon allowlisting and nested AIO provider restrictions.
- Added automatic source ranking, direct/debrid resolution, size verification,
  unknown-size review, and manual-source fallback.
- Added persistent batch/download models, resumable Android transfers,
  concurrency limits, network constraints, notifications, and queue actions.
- Added Nuvio Z application identity and launcher assets while retaining the
  upstream Kotlin namespace and callback schemes.
- Configured the official Nuvio backend through ignored local build properties;
  fixed the earlier `https://localhost` authentication fallback.
- Fixed preset editing crashes by enabling structured JSON map keys in download
  persistence.
- Fixed false “Conflicting source metadata” results by separating authoritative
  byte reports from rounded filename/display estimates and tolerating equivalent
  hard reports while retaining the largest cap-enforcement size.

## Verification

- Earlier comprehensive Android host suite: 477 tests passed.
- Latest focused source/preset suite:
  - `SourceFactsExtractorTest`: 8 passed.
  - `PresetDownloadsTest`: 10 passed.
- Signed `assembleFullRelease` completed successfully after the latest metadata
  fix.
- On-device preset smoke test:
  - edited and restored Saver and Quality controls;
  - survived process death and persistence reload;
  - no `AndroidRuntime` crash.
- On-device Daredevil Season 3 Balanced discovery:
  - all 13 episodes reached review with normal 1080p selections;
  - displayed sizes were approximately 0.3–0.8 GB;
  - no conflicting-metadata approvals;
  - review was dismissed without queuing downloads.

## Pending / Follow-up

- The local workspace directory is still named `stremio-z`; renaming it is
  deferred.
- Run the full host suite again after the next substantial code change.
- Test a real transfer end-to-end, including pause/resume, process death,
  network constraints, and cap-crossing approval, using a deliberately small
  file.
- Review lifecycle/cleanup for prepared batches dismissed from the review
  dialog so cancelled all-ready batches do not remain as hidden persisted
  records.
- Trakt functionality requires local client credentials and has not been
  reconfigured for this personal build.
- iOS parity gaps in the preset download feature, all in platform seams:
  `freeStorageBytes()` returns `-1` so low-space warnings and
  storage-triggered review never fire; `allowMeteredNetwork` is ignored
  because the iOS session hardcodes cellular access; downloads pause on
  app background because iOS uses a foreground `NSURLSession`.
- `DownloadsStorage.ios.kt` no longer profile-scopes its payload key,
  unlike every other iOS storage and unlike the desktop fork. Decide
  whether that de-scoping was intended.
- Desktop CI cannot be verified from a sandbox that blocks `dl.google.com`;
  the Android Gradle Plugin will not resolve there.

## Work Log

### 2026-08-02

- Reviewed iOS viability and distribution options for sharing personal
  builds; recorded the platform gaps above.
- Ported the preset and bulk download feature to the desktop fork
  (`Zokaper/NuvioZDesktop`, branch `claude/preset-bulk-downloads`) as a
  cherry-pick, since that repository shares history with this one.
  Resolved four conflicts, threaded the download callbacks through the
  desktop fork's two details layouts, and implemented `freeStorageBytes()`
  for desktop from the downloads directory's usable space.
- Excluded the Nuvio Z Android branding, the repository handoff documents,
  and the iOS profile-scoping change from that port.
- Added a `CI` workflow to both repositories: Android host tests and an
  unsigned debug APK artifact on every push, plus desktop compilation and
  tests in the desktop fork. Neither requires signing secrets.
- Not verified by a compiler in this environment; CI is the first real
  build of the ported feature.

### 2026-07-30

- Forked the inspected NuvioMobile base and implemented Nuvio Z preset/bulk
  downloads.
- Built and installed the signed arm64 release through ADB.
- Diagnosed sign-in failure from device logs and restored production backend
  configuration locally.
- Reproduced and fixed preset persistence crash; added regression coverage.
- Reproduced season-wide AIO metadata false conflicts; fixed and verified all 13
  Daredevil Season 3 selections on-device.
- Added shared `AGENTS.md`, Claude handoff instructions, and this status log.
- Created the private `Zokaper/nuvio-z` repository, preserved official Nuvio as
  `upstream`, configured the private fork as `origin`, and pushed `main`.
