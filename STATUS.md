# Nuvio Z Status

Last updated: 2026-08-03

## Current Snapshot

- Base: NuvioMobile commit `979d5680`.
- Working branch: `claude/download-pause-resume-priority-zb1nye` (download transfer
  and queue rework; the earlier unwatched-download work is already in `main`).
- Official repository is configured as `upstream`.
- Private `origin` repository: `https://github.com/Zokaper/nuvio-z`.
- Android identity: Nuvio Z, `com.nuvio.app.z`
  (`com.nuvio.app.z.debug` for debug).
- Signed personal release builds use an ignored local keystore.
- Latest signed arm64 APK was installed successfully on a Samsung Android
  device and launches alongside official Nuvio.

## Completed

- Added Saver, Balanced, and Quality download presets with editable resolution,
  GB/hour cap, codec, HDR/Dolby Vision, and audio-language preferences.
- Added movie, episode, season, and selected-season batch planning.
- Added an unwatched-only season scope so a season in progress downloads from the
  current episode onwards instead of the whole season.
- Added generic Stremio source normalization and bounded AIOStreams structured
  metadata support.
- Added global addon allowlisting and nested AIO provider restrictions.
- Added automatic source ranking, direct/debrid resolution, size verification,
  unknown-size review, and manual-source fallback.
- Added persistent batch/download models, resumable Android transfers,
  concurrency limits, network constraints, notifications, and queue actions.
- Added Nuvio Z application identity and launcher assets while retaining the
  upstream Kotlin namespace and callback schemes.
- Configured the official Nuvio backend through ignored local build properties;
  fixed the earlier `https://localhost` authentication fallback.
- Fixed preset editing crashes by enabling structured JSON map keys in download
  persistence.
- Fixed false “Conflicting source metadata” results by separating authoritative
  byte reports from rounded filename/display estimates and tolerating equivalent
  hard reports while retaining the largest cap-enforcement size.
- Reworked download transfers so a finished byte loop is only treated as a
  completed download when the bytes on disk match the authoritative total, and a
  total is never inferred from a transfer that stopped early.
- Added `If-Range` validators, correct 416 handling, and honest short/overrun
  outcomes to the Android, desktop, and iOS downloaders.
- Made pause a first-class outcome rather than a swallowed cancellation, split
  user pauses from system pauses, and added automatic resume on app foreground,
  reload, and connectivity recovery (including the missing iOS foreground hook).
- Added an explicit `Queued` state with persisted queue ranks, append-on-enqueue
  ordering, menu-based reordering with preemption, and retry with backoff.
- Coalesced progress persistence and notification updates instead of rewriting the
  whole payload on every chunk, and serialised repository mutations behind a lock.

## Verification

- Earlier comprehensive Android host suite: 477 tests passed.
- Latest focused source/preset suite:
  - `SourceFactsExtractorTest`: 8 passed.
  - `PresetDownloadsTest`: 10 passed (12 after the unwatched-scope tests were
    added; not yet executed, see below).
- Download transfer/queue rework (2026-08-03): Gradle still cannot configure here,
  so `DownloadTransfer.kt` and `DownloadQueuePlanner.kt` were compiled standalone
  against Kotlin 2.3.0 together with the two new test files, and all 27 tests
  (71 assertions) passed. This exercised the shipped sources, not copies, but it
  covers only those two files; no Android/iOS/desktop code was compiled. Every
  changed Kotlin file additionally passed a parser-only check.
- Signed `assembleFullRelease` completed successfully after the latest metadata
  fix.
- On-device preset smoke test:
  - edited and restored Saver and Quality controls;
  - survived process death and persistence reload;
  - no `AndroidRuntime` crash.
- On-device Daredevil Season 3 Balanced discovery:
  - all 13 episodes reached review with normal 1080p selections;
  - displayed sizes were approximately 0.3–0.8 GB;
  - no conflicting-metadata approvals;
  - review was dismissed without queuing downloads.

## Pending / Follow-up

- The download transfer/queue rework has **not** been compiled in this
  environment, and no Gradle task has run against it. Only the two new pure-logic
  files were verified, by compiling them standalone (see Verification). Everything
  else — the repository, the three platform downloaders, the screen — is
  unverified beyond a parse check. Run
  `.\gradlew.bat :composeApp:testAndroidHostTest` and an `assembleFullDebug`
  locally before trusting it.
- Smoke-test the reworked transfers on-device with a deliberately small file:
  pause/resume mid-transfer, resume after the source URL has expired (must not
  report a completed download at the partial size), process death mid-transfer,
  background/foreground on iOS, and a season batch to confirm E01 starts first and
  that "Download next" preempts.
- The unwatched-season download work has **not** been compiled or tested in this
  environment either: the sandbox blocks `dl.google.com`, so the Android Gradle
  Plugin cannot be resolved and no Gradle task can configure. Run
  `.\gradlew.bat :composeApp:testAndroidHostTest` and an `assembleFullDebug`
  locally before trusting it.
- Smoke-test the unwatched season download on-device: open a partly watched
  season, use the season download menu, and confirm only the current episode
  onwards is queued.
- The local workspace directory is still named `stremio-z`; renaming it is
  deferred.
- Run the full host suite again after the next substantial code change.
- Test a real transfer end-to-end, including pause/resume, process death,
  network constraints, and cap-crossing approval, using a deliberately small
  file.
- Review lifecycle/cleanup for prepared batches dismissed from the review
  dialog so cancelled all-ready batches do not remain as hidden persisted
  records.
- Trakt functionality requires local client credentials and has not been
  reconfigured for this personal build.

## Work Log

### 2026-08-03

- Root-caused the "resume says it completed" report: the read loop treated any end
  of stream as success, and `onSuccess(uri, totalBytes ?: finalSize)` adopted the
  truncated file's own length as the total, so a cut-short transfer rendered as a
  finished download at whatever byte count it had reached.
- Added `DownloadTransfer.kt` with the completion rule, retry policy, HTTP failure
  classification, progress-throttle thresholds, and the `resolveTotalBytes` /
  `parseContentRangeTotal` helpers that had been duplicated verbatim in all three
  platform downloaders.
- Replaced the platform downloader's loose callbacks with `DownloadTransferListener`
  so a pause can be reported as a pause; Android previously caught
  `CancellationException` in a generic `catch (Throwable)` and reported it as a
  failure, which only avoided showing up as a failed download because of a status
  check that lost the race.
- Fixed the 416 branch: an already complete `.part` is now finalized instead of
  being deleted and downloaded again from zero.
- Added `DownloadStatus.Queued`, persisted queue ranks, and `DownloadQueuePlanner`.
  Enqueue appends rather than prepends, so a season batch no longer downloads in
  reverse episode order.
- Added queue reordering (`Download next` / up / down / bottom) as a menu so it
  works with a TV remote, with preemption of the lowest priority running transfer.
- Split `DownloadPauseReason.User` from `System` and added
  `resumeSystemPausedDownloads`, wired to reload, connectivity recovery, and a new
  `applicationWillEnterForeground` hook on iOS — backgrounding the app used to
  pause every download permanently.
- Serialised repository mutations behind an atomicfu lock and coalesced persistence,
  replacing a full JSON payload rewrite on every 16 KiB chunk.
- Set aside an unparseable payload under a separate key instead of silently
  discarding every download, batch, and preset.
- Mirrored the same change into `Zokaper/NuvioZDesktop`, including the desktop
  downloader.

### 2026-08-02

- Added `DownloadScope.SeasonUnwatched`, an unwatched filter in
  `DownloadBatchPlanner`, and watch-state resolution in
  `PresetDownloadCoordinator`, so a season batch can skip everything already
  watched while keeping the episode currently in progress.
- Added `WatchingState.isEpisodeSeen` as the single watched-or-completed rule and
  pointed the details screen helper at it.
- Added the season download menu (whole season vs unwatched episodes) to the
  season header and a matching row in the season action sheet; both hide the
  unwatched option when a season has nothing left to watch.
- Stopped persisting a batch when a scope resolves to no episodes and reported
  the empty result in the preset dialog instead of queuing zero downloads.
- Added `PresetDownloadsTest` coverage for the unwatched scope, including the
  already-downloaded exclusion.
- Mirrored the same change into `Zokaper/NuvioZDesktop`.

### 2026-07-30

- Forked the inspected NuvioMobile base and implemented Nuvio Z preset/bulk
  downloads.
- Built and installed the signed arm64 release through ADB.
- Diagnosed sign-in failure from device logs and restored production backend
  configuration locally.
- Reproduced and fixed preset persistence crash; added regression coverage.
- Reproduced season-wide AIO metadata false conflicts; fixed and verified all 13
  Daredevil Season 3 selections on-device.
- Added shared `AGENTS.md`, Claude handoff instructions, and this status log.
- Created the private `Zokaper/nuvio-z` repository, preserved official Nuvio as
  `upstream`, configured the private fork as `origin`, and pushed `main`.
